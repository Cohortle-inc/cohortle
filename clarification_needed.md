I have made multiple attempts to locate the backend JavaScript file that contains the API route definitions you provided and where you wish to implement the cohort access restrictions. I have searched for the specific code patterns (`module.exports = function (app)`, `const app = express()`, `app.use`) across all relevant directories, but have been unsuccessful.

Without the exact, absolute file path to the backend file you wish me to modify, I cannot implement the requested functionality to restrict cohort access for learners on the backend.

Please provide the **exact, absolute file path** to the backend JavaScript file (e.g., `/path/to/your/project/src/api/routes/cohorts.js`) if you still wish for me to perform this task.

i already have the backend working, just focus on the frontend
